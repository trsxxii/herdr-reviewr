# Releasing

How to cut a herdr-reviewr release. A `v*` tag push is the trigger: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
creates the GitHub Release and uploads a prebuilt binary per target, and `herdr/install.sh`
downloads the matching asset on `herdr plugin install`.

## The one rule

**The manifest version and the tag must match.** `herdr/install.sh` reads `version` from
`herdr-plugin.toml`, sets `TAG="v${version}"`, and downloads from
`releases/download/${TAG}/`. A `0.2.0` manifest needs a `v0.2.0` tag, or installs 404.

Two files carry the version — keep them equal:

- `Cargo.toml` → `[package] version`
- `herdr-plugin.toml` → `version`

## Steps

Pick the new version with semver: a behavior change or new feature is a minor bump in `0.x`
(`0.1.1 → 0.2.0`); a fix-only release is a patch (`0.2.0 → 0.2.1`).

1. **Bump both versions** to the new `X.Y.Z` — `Cargo.toml` and `herdr-plugin.toml`.
2. **Finalize the changelog** — rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] — <date>` and add a fresh
   empty `## [Unreleased]` above it. The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).
3. **Refresh the lock** — `cargo build` so `Cargo.lock`'s `herdr-reviewr` entry updates to `X.Y.Z`.
4. **Verify green** — `just ci` (fmt-check, clippy, test, release build).
5. **Commit** the bump + changelog on a branch, review, and land it on `main`.
6. **Tag and push** — an annotated tag whose name is `vX.Y.Z`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "herdr-reviewr vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   git push origin vX.Y.Z        # triggers release.yml
   ```

7. **Watch the build** and confirm the assets landed:

   ```bash
   gh run watch                  # the release.yml run for the tag
   gh release view vX.Y.Z        # four <target>.tar.gz + .sha256 sidecars
   ```

## What the tag triggers

`release.yml` (on `push: tags: ["v*"]`):

- creates the Release for the tag if absent (`gh release create --verify-tag --generate-notes`);
- builds `herdr-reviewr` for `aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`,
  `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`;
- uploads each as `herdr-reviewr-<target>.tar.gz` with a `.sha256` sidecar.

The toolchain is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`, so CI and local builds match.

## Reinstall locally after a release

Switch your own machine from the dev link to the published release. This is also the cheapest
end-to-end test: it exercises the exact `herdr plugin install` path a user hits.

1. **Swap the link for the release.** Your config survives — `config.toml` lives in
   `~/.config/herdr/plugins/config/persiyanov.reviewr/`, keyed by plugin id, untouched by a reinstall.

   ```bash
   herdr plugin unlink persiyanov.reviewr
   herdr plugin install persiyanov/herdr-reviewr --yes   # install.sh downloads the vX.Y.Z binary
   herdr plugin list --plugin persiyanov.reviewr          # confirm: github source + version X.Y.Z
   ```

2. **Relaunch the sidebar** so the open pane runs the new binary instead of the old process.
   The `close` and `open` actions own the pane lifecycle — there is no state file to sync:

   ```bash
   herdr plugin action invoke close --plugin persiyanov.reviewr   # closes every reviewr pane
   herdr plugin action invoke open  --plugin persiyanov.reviewr   # opens the new binary
   ```

**Gotchas**

- The actions act on the focused workspace. Focus the workspace you want relaunched first.
- Closing then immediately reopening can briefly leave two `reviewr` panes (async lag) — a
  single `close` sweeps them all.

## Notes

- **`min_herdr_version`** (in `herdr-plugin.toml`) only changes when a release depends on a newer
  herdr API. A normal feature release leaves it as is.
- **Code signing** is a local-dev concern, not a release one: CI produces fresh binaries, while a
  contributor's in-place rebuild needs `just install` (see the README) to avoid an Apple-Silicon
  SIGKILL. Release assets are downloaded fresh by `install.sh`, so they are unaffected.
- **QA against the installed plugin** uses `just qa-install`, never a bare `cp`. Overwriting the
  installed binary in place invalidates its cached code signature, macOS SIGKILLs every launch,
  and the pane opens dead with no error — the recipe replaces the inode and ad-hoc re-signs.
  `just qa-restore` puts the released binary back.
- **`--verify-tag`** means the tag must exist on the remote before the Release is created — push
  the tag, don't create the Release by hand first.
