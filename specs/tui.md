# TUI

The terminal interface: the layout, the keyboard and mouse, and how the view stays current.

## Overview

```

- The header shows the three tabs with the active one highlighted, the active scope, the changed-file count with the scope's `+added −removed` line totals, and a clickable `Send` button with the comment count. The totals drop a zero side and vanish when nothing changed, like a file row's stats (`file-list.md`).
- The left pane is the selected file's diff (`diff-view.md`). The right pane is the file navigator (`file-list.md`).
- The comment input opens inline, directly under the last line of the selection. It pushes the diff below it down and grows as you type. It is never a footer band.
- The footer is a live action bar.
- The active tab sets both panes: diff and changed files in `Changes`, content and repo tree in `All files`, checks and comments in `PR`.
- The review loop is the same in `Changes` and `All files`. `PR` is a read-only mirror. Comments are one set across the authoring tabs and export together.

## Behavior

### Interaction

Every action has a key. The mouse-relevant ones also work by click or drag.

The keymap is rebindable per action through `[keybindings]` in the plugin config (`config.md`):

- The `action` column names the action for `[keybindings]`.
- The character keys are defaults.
- A key that is not a bare character (the arrows, `tab`, `esc`, `enter`, the page keys) is fixed.
- A key hint in the header or the footer shows its action's first bound key.
- The comments list acts through the same bindings and closes on `esc` and the `comments` binding.
- Prose and mockups elsewhere show the default keys.

Writing a comment: select a range or land on a line, press `c`, type into the inline box, `enter` saves and `esc` cancels. A saved comment renders as a read-only card spliced under its line, titled with its location, so written feedback stays on screen. `e` reopens the card as an edit box in place, hiding the card while editing. `d` deletes it. A successful send reports a transient `sent N comments` status that fades.

### Footer

The footer is a live action bar. It shows the actions available right now, the most likely one highlighted, and drops the least relevant when the line fills. It never lists a key that would not work in the current state.

```
 c comment · v select lines                          │ ⇥ files · 1·2·3 · q
```

The bar fills by priority until the width runs out, and a trailing `…` marks anything clipped:

| slot        | content                                                             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| primary     | the most likely next step, in a bright accent, always shown           |
| send        | `s send N`, present once any comment is written, just below the primary |
| actions     | what else works here, in normal text                                  |
| orientation | dim, stable: the pane toggle, the tab digits, quit; dropped first     |
| status      | a transient message (`comment added`) that fades, never replacing actions |

The actions follow the cursor:

| cursor on                                | primary          | also                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| a diff line                              | `c comment`      | `v select`              |
| a line of a markdown file that previews  | `c comment`      | `v select · m preview`  |
| a live selection                         | `c comment`      | `esc clear`             |
| a commented line                         | `e edit`         | `d delete · n/N jump`   |
| a fold                                   | `→ expand fold`  | —                       |
| an open markdown preview                 | `m source`       | —                       |
| a file (file list)                       | `⇥ diff`         | —                       |
| a collapsed directory                    | `→ expand`       | —                       |
| an expanded directory                    | `← collapse`     | —                       |
| nothing to review (awaiting turn)        | `u/b/t scope`    | `r refresh`             |

- `u/b/t scope` shows in every `Changes` and `All files` context, except where it is itself the primary.
- Movement keys are never shown.
- The comment editor and the comments list show their own actions.
- The changed-file count and line totals live in the header. The footer carries only the comment count, inside `s send N`.
- On `PR` the bar leads with the PR's state, then `o open ↗`, then orientation.

### Tabs

- Each tab owns its state: the open file or card, scroll, cursor, expansions, the preview choice. Nothing carries between tabs.
- Switching away and back restores the tab exactly.
- A first visit opens the tab's first file or card. A collapsed tree with the cursor on a directory opens nothing until a pick.
- A tab switch keeps the focused side. An empty left pane focuses the tree.

### PR tab

A read-only mirror of the pull request in the same two-pane frame: the right pane navigates checks and comments, the left pane reads the selected comment, the header carries the PR's identity and state. It reads GitHub through `forge-host.md` and writes nothing. Its only outward action opens a link in the browser.

```

- The header right-anchors a clickable `status #226 ↗` chip, status colored by lifecycle: `open` green, `draft` yellow, `merged` mauve, `closed` red. The PR title sits to its left, truncated to fit.
- Between title and chip sits the resolved head branch (`head_ref`, `forge-host.md`), dim, prefixed `⑂ ` when the head lives in a fork. On a narrow bar the branch drops first.
- The footer leads with merge, sync, checks, and comment counts. Merge and sync show only while the PR is open. A capped surface appends `+more on GitHub ↗` (`forge-host.md`).
- The right pane, titled `Checks & comments`, shows a status-only checks section above the comments list. The cursor walks the description row and the comments.
- Comments list newest first, each row `@author anchor age`, with `outdated` or `resolved` markers where GitHub receded the thread.
- A non-empty PR description pins a `description` row at the top of the navigator, above the checks. An emptied description vanishes like a comment: the cursor clamps, the read pane resets.
- The left pane reads the selected comment: a finding shows its `snippet` then the body, a review or plain comment shows its prose, the description row shows the PR description.
- Bodies render as markdown (`markdown.md`). A finding's `snippet` stays plain `+`/`−`-colored lines.
- A human author is emphasized over the bots.
- `j`/`k` or a click selects a comment. `PageUp`/`PageDown` and the wheel scroll the read pane, stopping with the last line at the pane's bottom edge. `o` or the chip opens the PR in the browser.
- A body taller than the read pane shows a scrollbar on the pane's right border. One that fits shows none.
- The authoring keys (`s`, `c`, `v`, `d`, `e`) do nothing here.
- A merged or closed PR shows the same mirror, read-only.
- No open PR, or no usable `gh`, shows the matching empty state from `forge-host.md`, naming the command that unblocks it.

### Comment editor

A plain-text field that edits at the caret, not only at the end. An empty box shows a dim `Leave a comment…` placeholder. `e` preloads the existing text with the caret at the end.

- A paste arrives whole via bracketed paste. A multi-line paste keeps its newlines. `\r\n` and `\r` normalize to `\n`.
- Movement, insertion, and deletion are character-wise. Multi-byte and wide characters count as whole characters.
- `↑`/`↓` move by wrapped rows. `Home`/`End` and the kill keys act on the logical line, the run of text between explicit newlines.
- `Alt+b`/`Alt+f` always survive as ESC-prefixed sequences. The modified arrows work where the terminal delivers them. The character arrows, `Home`/`End`, and `Ctrl+A`/`Ctrl+E` always work.

### Refresh

- The view polls the worktree every `N` seconds, default 2, configurable.
- A poll reloads the file list and the open diff, keeping the selected file and scroll where the file still exists.
- While a comment is being composed, the input and its diff are frozen. The file list still updates.
- `r` forces an immediate reload.
- The `PR` tab fetches on open, on entering the tab, on `r`, and on the agent's turn-end while active, with a slow fallback timer. Its cadence is separate from the worktree poll.
- A PR refetch keeps your place: the cursor follows the selected comment by identity, the read-pane scroll holds. A vanished comment clamps the cursor and resets the read pane.
- Refresh uses no herdr events. The same poll samples the agent's status for the `last-turn` baseline (`herdr-host.md`).
- In `last-turn` scope, before a turn start is observed, `Changes` shows `waiting for the agent's next turn`, never a stale or whole-worktree diff. `All files` keeps its content.

## Failure semantics

- A poll never touches the comment input or saved comments. Draft text and caret survive every refresh.
- A config error replaces the view. Saved comments always survive. An open composer or comments list survives with its tab's state. Recovery restores them.
- A poll that finds no change makes no visible update: no flicker, no lost selection or scroll.
- Git, clipboard, and agent-send calls run synchronously between frames. A very large diff or a hung send can briefly block input. Moving them off the draw path is a v1 non-goal.
- A paste outside the comment editor is ignored. It never starts or mutates a comment.

## Non-goals

- No editing, staging, or committing from the UI.
- No side-by-side split view. The diff is one unified column, split is roadmap.
- No jump from a PR comment's anchor to the code tabs.
- No text selection, cut/copy, undo/redo, markdown rendering, or click-to-place-caret in the comment editor.
- No modifier, named-key, or sequence notation in the keymap. Single characters are the v1 surface.
