# TUI

The terminal interface: how the review is laid out, how you drive it by keyboard and mouse, and how it stays current.

## Overview

```

- The header shows the active tab, the scope, the file count, and a clickable `Send` button with the comment count.
- The left pane is the selected file's diff — syntax-highlighted, with line numbers, change bars, word-level emphasis, and foldable context, defined in `diff-view.md`.
- The right pane is the changed-files navigator for the current scope — a directory tree, defined in `file-list.md`.
- The comment input opens **inline, directly under the last line of the selection**, pushing the diff below it down; it grows as you type more lines. It is not a footer band.
- The footer is a key-hint and status line.

The tab bar shows `Changes`, and leaves room for the roadmap `All files` and `Checks` tabs.

## Behavior

### Interaction

Every action has a keyboard binding. The mouse-relevant ones also work by click or drag, since herdr is mouse-native. The specific keys are a provisional v1, not a final keymap.

| action | keyboard | mouse |
|--------|----------|-------|
| move the cursor in the focused pane — in the file list this selects a file and loads its diff | `j` / `k` / `↑` / `↓` | click a file row |
| open the selected file's diff, or toggle the selected directory | `enter` | click a file or directory row |
| collapse / expand the directory under the cursor | `←` / `→` | click the directory row |
| switch focus between the file list and the diff | `tab` | click a pane |
| scroll the diff | `PageUp` / `PageDown` / `ctrl+u` / `ctrl+d` | wheel |
| scroll the diff horizontally, when wrap is off | `←` / `→` | — |
| switch scope | `u` uncommitted / `b` branch | click the scope in the header |
| expand the fold under the cursor | `enter` | click the `⋯` fold row |
| toggle line wrap | `w` | — |
| resize the panes — widen / narrow the file list | `]` / `[` | drag the divider between the panes |
| select a line range, removed lines included | `v` then move | click-drag in the diff |
| comment on the selection | `c`, type, `enter` | after a drag-select |
| insert a newline in a comment | `Alt+Enter` / `Shift+Enter` / `Ctrl+J` | — |
| delete the previous word in a comment | `Ctrl+W` | — |
| edit the comment under the cursor | `e` | — |
| delete the comment under the cursor | `d` | — |
| jump to next / previous comment | `n` / `N` | — |
| list and manage all comments | `l` | — |
| send all written comments to the agent | `s` / `S` | click `Send` |
| copy all written comments to the clipboard | `y` / `Y` | — |
| refresh now | `r` | — |
| quit | `q` | — |

Writing a comment: select a range or land on a line, press `c`, and an input box opens **inline under the last selected line**. Type — `Alt+Enter` / `Shift+Enter` / `Ctrl+J` inserts a newline, `Ctrl+W` deletes the previous word — then `enter` saves or `esc` cancels. The box grows to fit the text as it wraps to the box width, not only on explicit newlines.

On save the input box closes and the comment stays visible: it renders as a **read-only card spliced inline under its line**, titled with its location, so written feedback is always on screen while reviewing rather than hidden behind a marker. `e` reopens the card under the cursor as an edit box in place (its card is hidden while editing); `d` deletes it. There is no single-vs-all choice: `s` / `S` (or the `Send` button) sends every written comment, and a successful send reports a transient status such as `sent 3 comments` that fades after a few seconds.

### Refresh

- The view polls the worktree every `N` seconds, default `2`, overridable by config.
- A poll reloads the changed-files list and the open diff, keeping the selected file and scroll position where the file still exists.
- While you are composing a comment, the input and the diff you are commenting on are frozen; the file list still updates.
- `r` forces an immediate reload.
- Refresh is independent of agent state; it uses no herdr events.

## Failure semantics

- A poll never touches the comment input or saved comments, so you can comment while the agent writes files without losing anything.
- A poll that finds no change makes no visible update: no flicker, no lost selection or scroll, no interruption to an in-progress comment.
- A git or clipboard call runs off the draw path, so a slow call never freezes input.

## Non-goals

- No editing, staging, or committing from the UI — review and comment only.
- No side-by-side split view — the diff is one unified column; split is roadmap.

## Decisions

- Two-pane focus, not scope on `tab` — `j`/`k` drive whichever pane is focused, and `tab` switches focus. Anchoring comments and jumping between them needs a per-line diff cursor, so the diff is independently focusable rather than scroll-only; scope moves to `u`/`b` (and a clickable scope chip).
- Poll on a timer, not on agent turns — turn transitions are too coarse and slow for timely refresh; polling is simple and predictable.
- Keyboard and mouse together — the asked-for flow includes a clickable `Send` button and click-to-open files.
- Inline comment input — the box opens under the selected line (insert: the diff below shifts down) rather than in a detached footer, so the comment sits with the code it is about; it grows to fit multi-line text.
- One `Send`, not send-one vs send-all — there is just a set of written comments; `s` / `S` / the button send them all. Removing the distinction drops a needless choice from the hot path.
- Component architecture — each region (`TabBar`, `FileList`, `DiffView`, `CommentInput`, `StatusBar`) owns its state and is testable in isolation, over a single monolithic update.
- A structured diff viewer, not rendered git-diff text — the diff pane renders the model in `diff-view.md` (syntax, line numbers, change bars, word emphasis, folds), so the pane shows code, not raw `git diff` plumbing.

## Open decisions

- Keymap — the v1 bindings are provisional; the final shortcut set is a separate discussion.
