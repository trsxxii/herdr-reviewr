# forge host

How reviewr reads one pull request from GitHub — identity, state, checks, comments — through the `gh` CLI, for the read-only `PR` tab (`tui.md`). It never writes back.

## Overview

reviewr resolves the worktree's open pull request across the candidate branches its work could be published under, then reads a snapshot of it through `gh` on each poll. The snapshot is the single value the `PR` tab renders.

```
PR #226  open  persiyanov/deep-research-benchmark → main   ⇡ 2 unpushed
  merge      ⚠ conflicts with main
  checks     ✗ failing — ✓ build-main-image · ✓ review · ✗ tests
  comments   5 (newest first) — @you 5m · @codex 2h · @claude 2h · …
```

The snapshot:

| field          | type      | meaning                                                                |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `title`, `url` | string    | identity                                                               |
| `body`         | string    | the PR description as GitHub returns it, empty when none               |
| `state`        | enum      | `open`, `merged`, or `closed`                                          |
| `is_draft`     | bool      | draft flag                                                             |
| `head_ref`     | string    | the PR's head branch name, which may differ from the local branch      |
| `head_is_fork` | bool      | the head lives in another repository (GitHub's `isCrossRepository`)    |
| `base_ref`     | string    | the merge target                                                       |
| `merge`        | enum      | `clean`, `conflicting`, or `blocked`                                   |
| `sync`         | enum      | `in_sync`, `unpushed`, `behind`, or `unknown`, with a count when known |
| `checks`       | list      | one row per latest check: `name` and `status` (conclusion folded in)   |
| `comments`     | list      | one row per comment, newest first                                      |
| `truncated`    | bool      | a capped surface had a further page, so a list is a prefix             |

A `comments` row:

| field                        | type   | meaning                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`                       | enum   | `review` (a review's body), `comment` (conversation), `finding` (inline) |
| `author`, `author_is_bot`    | string, bool | the `@login` and whether it is a bot                              |
| `anchor`                     | string | `path:line` for a `finding`, the literal kind word otherwise            |
| `body`, `snippet`            | string | the text as GitHub returns it, no chrome-stripping or format parsing; only a `finding` carries a snippet |
| `created_at`                 | time   | post time, the newest-first sort key                                    |
| `is_resolved`, `is_outdated` | bool   | thread state for a `finding`, always false otherwise                    |
| `reply_count`                | int    | replies on a `finding`'s thread beyond the root                         |

## Behavior

### GitHub hosts

`github_host` in reviewr's `config.toml` adds one GitHub Enterprise hostname. Its value contract lives in `config.md`.

```toml
github_host = "github.example.com"
```

Host matching is case-insensitive. A missing setting adds no Enterprise host. `github.com` remains supported when the setting is present.

A readable, supported remote named `upstream` is authoritative. An absent or unusable `upstream`
identity falls back to `origin`; a Git read failure stays visible and never falls through. Both use
the primary fetch URL after Git's `url.*.insteadOf` rewrite. A separate push URL does not affect PR
reads.

| remote state                                                               | outcome                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `upstream` names `github.com` or exact `github_host` with `owner/repository` | reviewr reads that repository                                            |
| `upstream` is absent, hostless, unsupported, or malformed                  | `origin` determines the repository                                       |
| reading `upstream` fails                                                   | reviewr shows the retryable Git error and never falls through            |
| `origin` names `github.com` or exact `github_host` with `owner/repository`   | reviewr reads that repository                                            |
| `origin` names another hosted repository                                   | reviewr names the unsupported host and points Enterprise users to config |
| `origin` is missing or hostless                                            | reviewr says the PR tab needs a supported GitHub `upstream` or `origin`   |
| `origin` names a supported host without `owner/repository`                  | reviewr says the GitHub origin is malformed                              |
| reading `origin` fails                                                     | reviewr shows the retryable Git error                                    |

A fork clone with `origin` pointed at the fork and a supported `upstream` pointed at the base
repository resolves the base repository's PR without setup.

Canonical SSH remotes work in scp-style (`git@host:owner/repository.git`) and `ssh://` forms. Hosted
URL forms use `http://`, `https://`, or `git://`. File URLs and other schemes are not GitHub
repository identities. SSH aliases are not inferred as canonical GitHub hosts. `GH_HOST` cannot
redirect a fetch.

### Resolution

- Each fetch pins `HEAD` and the base ref to commit OIDs. Ancestry, distance, and sync calculations use those pins while the agent commits beside it.
- The open PR resolves across all candidate branches.
- Exactly one open PR across the candidates resolves, under whichever name it lives.
- Several open PRs resolve to the earliest candidate in derivation order. Several on that one name disambiguate by `headRefOid` equal to the pinned `HEAD`. Failing that, reviewr surfaces the ambiguity count, never a silent guess.
- With no open PR anywhere, the newest-created merged or closed PR shows as historical state. With none at all, the body says only `No pull request yet. Ready to ship?`
- A fork PR reads checks, comments, and merge state from the base repository. The resolution key is the head branch name, not a (repository, name) pair, so a same-named fork branch can match. The `⑂` header marker makes that case visible.
- A detached `HEAD` shows the empty state. reviewr never queries `headRefName:""`, which GitHub reads as unfiltered.

### Candidate branches

Each fetch re-derives and deduplicates the possible publication names in this order. Steps 1 and 3 always remain. Step 2 contributes the nearest tips up to 8 total names.

1. Git's recorded upstream (`branch.<name>.merge`), stripped of its remote prefix, unless it names a configured base branch. `@{push}` is never consulted: git computes a destination even when nothing is recorded, which would shadow a real upstream.
2. Remote-tracking branches under `refs/remotes/origin/*` (excluding `origin/HEAD` and the base branches) whose tip is ancestry-comparable with the pinned `HEAD`: equal to it, an ancestor of it carrying non-base work, or a descendant of it. Nearest-first by `HEAD...tip` distance, ties lexicographic. With no base resolvable, only equal and descendant tips qualify.
3. The local branch name, always.

What a user observes:

- A worktree pushed as `git push origin HEAD:<other-name>` resolves its PR. The push updated a distance-0 candidate.
- One tip pushed under two names resolves to whichever name holds the open PR.
- A stale upstream never hides a live PR on another candidate. An open PR beats a merged one and beats none.
- A teammate's branch parked at this worktree's exact `HEAD` never beats the branch git says this worktree pushes to.
- Stacked branches resolve to the nearest branch of the stack holding an open PR. The recorded push destination outranks the whole stack.
- A remote branch descending from `HEAD` can be a colleague's continuation of this work. Its PR resolves when no better candidate has one, and the header names the branch.
- Between a rebase and its force-push, a branch published under a different name with no upstream shows the empty state. The push restores it on the next poll.

### Derived state

- `merge` folds GitHub's fields to the blockers worth surfacing: `CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY` → `conflicting`, `BLOCKED` → `blocked`, and everything else (`CLEAN`, `BEHIND`, `UNSTABLE`, still-computing `UNKNOWN`) → `clean`, which the footer shows as nothing.
- `mergeable=UNKNOWN` is GitHub computing lazily. It folds to `clean` unless `mergeStateStatus` is `DIRTY`.
- `sync` compares the pinned `HEAD` OID to the PR's `head_oid`: equal is `in_sync`, `HEAD` ahead is `unpushed` with a `git rev-list --count` count, and `head_oid` ahead is `behind`. If the PR head object is unavailable locally, the relation is `unknown`; reviewr never guesses `in_sync`.
- `unpushed` means the checks and comments on screen describe an older commit than the local tree.

### Checks

- A check row is the latest run for its name. A passed re-run replaces an earlier failure.
- Check runs and commit statuses normalize into one list.
- A top-level rollup gives the overall pass or fail.

### Comments

- Three surfaces merge into one list: submitted reviews, inline threads, and conversation comments.
- A bot's PR-level posts collapse to its latest. A human's are each kept.
- `is_resolved` and `is_outdated` come from GitHub, never recomputed against the worktree.
- Outdated and resolved threads stay in the list with their marker.
- Each surface reads one page of 100 rows, never paged to exhaustion. A further page on any surface — reviews, comments, threads, or checks — sets `truncated`, and the UI shows `+more on GitHub ↗`, so a capped list is never presented as complete.

### Refresh

- The first fetch starts when the panel opens, so the tab is populated before the user reaches it.
- A refetch fires on entering the tab, on the `refresh` binding (default `r`), and on the agent's turn-end (a `working` → `idle`/`done` edge) on any tab. A turn may have pushed or merged, changing forge state with no other local signal, and one fetch per turn keeps the tab fresh before it is entered.
- A fallback poll refetches every 60 seconds while the tab is active. Off the tab there is no polling.
- The candidate list is the search space, not the identity. It can churn on a mere commit, so churn alone never blanks the tab.
- A refresh that observes a different repository target clears the current PR. So does candidate churn that drops the branch the painted pull request resolved on. In both cases reviewr cannot prove the snapshot still describes the same pull request (`overview.md` Continuity).
- Every other observed change — a moved `HEAD`, candidate churn around a still-candidate pull request, churn with nothing resolved on screen — keeps the snapshot painted and refetches behind it. The same pull request with newer commits is stale, not wrong. The refreshing indicator covers the gap.
- Either observation starts the replacement fetch at once, on or off the tab, so entering the tab finds fresh work already underway.
- One fetch is in flight at a time. One or more triggers arriving mid-flight supersede its result and start one fresh fetch when it completes.
- A GitHub change during a fetch can appear on the following fetch.
- Each fetch uses one snapshot of reviewr's config for host and base selection. A later fetch sees a config edit without restarting reviewr.
- A GitHub result paints only if the current config, repository target, pinned `HEAD`, and candidate
  branches still match the input that produced it. If reviewr cannot prove that match, the result
  never paints, and one replacement fetch starts against the current input.
- If the repository target is proven unchanged before a later branch-state read fails, the visible
  same-target snapshot stays with a retry notice; the next refresh performs a fresh GitHub fetch.
- The snapshot re-derives in full each fetch. reviewr keeps no hidden or historical PR cache beyond the visible snapshot.
- Exiting reviewr stops scheduling and restores the terminal immediately. No later PR completion
  can paint.

## Failure semantics

reviewr reads GitHub and never writes it, so every failure degrades to a clear state. `Changes` and `All files` are unaffected.

- A missing `gh` preserves a same-input snapshot and shows the install remedy. With no same-input snapshot, the remedy fills the tab.
- An unauthenticated fetch preserves a same-input snapshot and shows `gh auth login --hostname <host>`. With no same-input snapshot, the remedy fills the tab.
- A failure before the repository target resolves replaces any snapshot with the retryable Git error. reviewr cannot prove that the snapshot still belongs to the current target.
- A branch-state Git failure after the same repository target resolves preserves the visible
  same-target snapshot with the retryable Git error.
- An unsupported origin names the host and points Enterprise users to `github_host`.
- Any other fetch failure preserves a same-input snapshot and shows the retry error. With no same-input snapshot, the error fills the tab.
- No PR at any lifecycle state shows a calm empty state. The next poll lights the tab up when a PR appears.
- Every read is side-effect-free.
- Two active PR tabs on one worktree converge within one poll interval. An inactive tab catches up when entered.

## Non-goals

- No writes to GitHub. reviewr never posts, resolves a thread, re-runs a check, or merges. It never routes PR feedback to the agent.
- No repository selector or cross-repository search. A readable, supported `upstream` is
  authoritative; an unusable `upstream` identity falls back to `origin`.
- No different parent repositories across sibling worktrees from one clone. Use a separate clone for each parent.
- No SSH host-alias normalization. An alias-only repository needs a canonical-host remote.
- No discovery of an unrecorded publication name on a non-`origin` remote. The local branch name or a recorded upstream must identify it.
- No event subscription. The snapshot polls `gh`, no webhook or socket.
- No server-version compatibility layer for Enterprise schemas.
- No second forge. GitHub via `gh` only.
