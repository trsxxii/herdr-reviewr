# forge host

How reviewr reads one pull request from GitHub — identity, state, checks, comments — through the `gh` CLI, for the read-only `PR` tab (`tui.md`). It never writes back.

## Overview

reviewr resolves the worktree's open pull request across the candidate branches its work could be published under, then reads a snapshot of it through `gh` on each poll. The snapshot is the single value the `PR` tab renders.

```
PR #226  open  persiyanov/deep-research-benchmark → main   ⇡ 2 unpushed
  merge      ⚠ conflicts with main
  checks     ✗ failing — ✓ build-main-image · ✓ review · ✗ tests
  comments   5 (newest first) — @you 5m · @codex 2h · @claude 2h · …
```

The snapshot:

| field          | type      | meaning                                                                |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `number`       | int?      | PR number, `null` when no PR resolves                                  |
| `title`, `url` | string    | identity                                                               |
| `body`         | string    | the PR description as GitHub returns it, empty when none               |
| `state`        | enum      | `open`, `merged`, or `closed`                                          |
| `is_draft`     | bool      | draft flag                                                             |
| `head_ref`     | string    | the PR's head branch name, which may differ from the local branch      |
| `head_is_fork` | bool      | the head lives in another repository (GitHub's `isCrossRepository`)    |
| `base_ref`     | string    | the merge target                                                       |
| `merge`        | enum      | `clean`, `conflicting`, or `blocked`                                   |
| `sync`         | enum      | `in_sync`, `unpushed`, `behind`, or `unknown`, with a count when known |
| `checks`       | list      | one row per latest check: `name` and `status` (conclusion folded in)   |
| `comments`     | list      | one row per comment, newest first                                      |
| `truncated`    | bool      | a capped surface had a further page, so a list is a prefix             |

A `comments` row:

| field                        | type   | meaning                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`                       | enum   | `review` (a review's body), `comment` (conversation), `finding` (inline) |
| `author`, `author_is_bot`    | string, bool | the `@login` and whether it is a bot                              |
| `anchor`                     | string | `path:line` for a `finding`, the literal kind word otherwise            |
| `body`, `snippet`            | string | the text as GitHub returns it, no chrome-stripping or format parsing; only a `finding` carries a snippet |
| `created_at`                 | time   | post time, the newest-first sort key                                    |
| `is_resolved`, `is_outdated` | bool   | thread state for a `finding`, always false otherwise                    |
| `reply_count`                | int    | replies on a `finding`'s thread beyond the root                         |

## Behavior

### GitHub hosts

`github_host` in reviewr's `config.toml` adds one GitHub Enterprise hostname. Its value contract lives in `config.md`.

```toml
github_host = "github.example.com"
```

Host matching is case-insensitive. A missing setting adds no Enterprise host. `github.com` remains supported when the setting is present.

Host identity comes from `origin`'s primary fetch URL after Git's `url.*.insteadOf` rewrite. A separate push URL does not affect PR reads.

| condition                                                 | outcome                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| exact `github_host` or SSH alias `github_host-<alias>`    | reviewr reads the repository from the configured Enterprise host                |
| `github.com` or SSH alias `github.com-<alias>`            | reviewr reads the repository from GitHub.com                                    |
| any other hosted `origin`                                 | reviewr names the unsupported host and points Enterprise users to `github_host` |
| missing `origin` or an origin without a host              | reviewr says the PR tab needs a supported GitHub origin                         |
| supported host without an owner and repository path       | reviewr says the GitHub origin is malformed                                     |

The alias rows apply only to scp-style and `ssh://` origins. An alias is a trusted naming convention; reviewr does not inspect SSH config to verify where it connects.

Hosted URL forms use `http://`, `https://`, or `git://`. File URLs and other schemes are not GitHub repository identities and remain unsupported.

A fetch target is the canonical matched host plus the origin's owner and repository. A fetch input adds the pinned `HEAD` and derived candidate branches. Base configuration shapes those candidates but is not a second identity of its own. `GH_HOST` cannot redirect a fetch to another instance.

### Resolution

- Each fetch pins `HEAD` and the base ref to commit OIDs at its start. Every ancestry test, distance, and sync count uses the pins, so one fetch reads one consistent local state while the agent commits beside it.
- The open PR is resolved across all candidate branches in one aliased GraphQL `pullRequests(headRefName: …, states: OPEN)` call. Its detail comes from a direct `pullRequest(number: …)` query, because `mergeable` populates only on direct access.
- Exactly one open PR across the candidates resolves, under whichever name it lives.
- Several open PRs resolve to the earliest candidate in derivation order. Several on that one name disambiguate by `headRefOid` equal to the pinned `HEAD`. Failing that, reviewr surfaces the ambiguity count, never a silent guess.
- With no open PR anywhere, the newest-created merged or closed PR shows as historical state. With none at all, the empty state names the queried candidates, so a surprising resolution is inspectable.
- A fork PR reads checks, comments, and merge state from the base repository. The resolution key is the head branch name, not a (repository, name) pair, so a same-named fork branch can match. The `⑂` header marker makes that case visible.
- A detached `HEAD` shows the empty state. reviewr never queries `headRefName:""`, which GitHub reads as unfiltered.

### Candidate branches

The names this worktree's work could be published under, re-derived from local git on every fetch, deduped in this order. Steps 1 and 3 are always included. Step 2 contributes nearest tips up to a total of 8 names, farthest evicted first, never evicting steps 1 or 3.

1. Git's recorded upstream (`branch.<name>.merge`), stripped of its remote prefix, unless it names a configured base branch. `@{push}` is never consulted: git computes a destination even when nothing is recorded, which would shadow a real upstream.
2. Remote-tracking branches under `refs/remotes/origin/*` (excluding `origin/HEAD` and the base branches) whose tip is ancestry-comparable with the pinned `HEAD`: equal to it, an ancestor of it carrying non-base work, or a descendant of it. Nearest-first by `HEAD...tip` distance, ties lexicographic. With no base resolvable, only equal and descendant tips qualify.
3. The local branch name, always.

What a user observes:

- A worktree pushed as `git push origin HEAD:<other-name>` resolves its PR. The push updated a distance-0 candidate.
- One tip pushed under two names resolves to whichever name holds the open PR.
- A stale upstream never hides a live PR on another candidate. An open PR beats a merged one and beats none.
- A teammate's branch parked at this worktree's exact `HEAD` never beats the branch git says this worktree pushes to.
- Stacked branches resolve to the nearest branch of the stack holding an open PR. The recorded push destination outranks the whole stack.
- A remote branch descending from `HEAD` can be a colleague's continuation of this work. Its PR resolves when no better candidate has one, and the header names the branch.
- Between a rebase and its force-push, a branch published under a different name with no upstream shows the empty state. The push restores it on the next poll.

### Derived state

- `merge` folds GitHub's fields to the blockers worth surfacing: `CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY` → `conflicting`, `BLOCKED` → `blocked`, and everything else (`CLEAN`, `BEHIND`, `UNSTABLE`, still-computing `UNKNOWN`) → `clean`, which the footer shows as nothing.
- `mergeable=UNKNOWN` is GitHub computing lazily. It folds to `clean` unless `mergeStateStatus` is `DIRTY`.
- `sync` compares the pinned `HEAD` OID to the PR's `head_oid`: equal is `in_sync`, `HEAD` ahead is `unpushed` with a `git rev-list --count` count, and `head_oid` ahead is `behind`. If the PR head object is unavailable locally, the relation is `unknown`; reviewr never guesses `in_sync`.
- `unpushed` means the checks and comments on screen describe an older commit than the local tree.

### Checks

- A check row is the latest run for its name. A passed re-run replaces an earlier failure.
- Check runs and commit statuses normalize into one list.
- A top-level rollup gives the overall pass or fail.

### Comments

- Three surfaces merge into one list: submitted reviews, inline threads, and conversation comments. The AI reviewers split across them, so all three are read.
- A bot's PR-level posts collapse to its latest. A human's are each kept.
- `is_resolved` and `is_outdated` come from GitHub, never recomputed against the worktree.
- Outdated and resolved threads stay in the list with their marker.
- Each surface reads one page of 100 rows, never paged to exhaustion. A further page on any surface — reviews, comments, threads, or checks — sets `truncated`, and the UI shows `+more on GitHub ↗`, so a capped list is never presented as complete.

### Refresh

- The first fetch starts when the panel opens, so the tab is populated before the user reaches it.
- A refetch fires on entering the tab, on the `refresh` binding (default `r`), and on the agent's turn-end (a `working` → `idle`/`done` edge) while the tab is active. A turn may have pushed or merged, changing forge state with no other local signal.
- A fallback poll refetches every 60 seconds while the tab is active. Off the tab there is no polling.
- A fetch-input change observed on refresh clears the current PR. It starts a fetch while the tab is active; otherwise the next tab entry starts it.
- A fetch with an open PR is two GraphQL calls. A fetch that checks historical PRs is three. All run on a worker thread, so `gh` never blocks input or scrolling.
- One fetch is in flight at a time. A trigger arriving mid-flight supersedes its result and starts a fresh fetch when it completes.
- Each fetch uses one snapshot of reviewr's config for host and base selection. A later fetch sees a config edit without restarting reviewr.
- A completed fetch updates the PR tab only when the current worktree still derives the same target, pinned `HEAD`, and candidates. Config changes separately invalidate in-flight work before re-derivation.
- The snapshot re-derives in full each fetch. reviewr keeps no hidden or historical PR cache beyond the visible snapshot.

## Failure semantics

reviewr reads GitHub and never writes it, so every failure degrades to a clear state. `Changes` and `All files` are unaffected.

- A missing `gh` preserves a same-input snapshot and shows the install remedy. With no same-input snapshot, the remedy fills the tab.
- An unauthenticated fetch preserves a same-input snapshot and shows `gh auth login --hostname <host>`. With no same-input snapshot, the remedy fills the tab.
- An unsupported origin names the host and points Enterprise users to `github_host`.
- Any other fetch failure preserves a same-input snapshot and shows the retry error. With no same-input snapshot, the error fills the tab.
- A missing `origin` is a clean absence. Any other git command failure is transient and never read as absence, a detached `HEAD`, or an unsupported remote.
- No open PR shows a directional empty state naming the queried candidates. The next poll lights the tab up when a PR appears.
- Every read is idempotent and side-effect-free. A retry returns the same snapshot.
- Two active PR tabs on one worktree converge within one poll interval. An inactive tab catches up when entered.

## Non-goals

- No writes to GitHub. reviewr never posts, resolves a thread, re-runs a check, or merges. It never routes PR feedback to the agent.
- No event subscription. The snapshot polls `gh`, no webhook or socket.
- No server-version compatibility layer. An Enterprise schema that lacks the snapshot's fields fails like any unavailable GitHub API.
- No second forge. GitHub via `gh` only, and the forge-agnostic core never imports this module.
