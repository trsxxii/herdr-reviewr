# forge host

How reviewr reads one pull request from GitHub — identity, state, checks, comments — through the `gh` CLI, for the read-only `PR` tab (`pr-tab.md`). It never writes back.

## Overview

reviewr resolves the worktree's pull request through its published commits, then reads a snapshot of it through `gh` on each poll. Every shown PR provably contains this worktree's work. The snapshot is the single value the `PR` tab renders.

```
PR #226  open  persiyanov/deep-research-benchmark → main   ⇡ 2 unpushed
  merge      ⚠ conflicts with main
  checks     ✗ failing — ✓ build-main-image · ✓ review · ✗ tests
  comments   5 (newest first) — @you 5m · @codex 2h · @claude 2h · …
```

The snapshot:

| field                  | type   | meaning                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `number`               | int?   | PR number, `null` when no PR resolves                                       |
| `title`, `url`         | string | identity                                                                    |
| `body`                 | string | the PR description as GitHub returns it, empty when none                    |
| `state`                | enum   | `open`, `merged`, or `closed`                                               |
| `is_draft`             | bool   | draft flag                                                                  |
| `head_ref`             | string | the PR's head branch name, which may differ from the local branch           |
| `head_is_fork`         | bool   | the head lives in another repository (GitHub's `isCrossRepository`)         |
| `base_ref`             | string | the merge target                                                            |
| `merge`                | enum   | `clean`, `conflicting`, or `blocked`                                        |
| `sync`                 | enum   | `in_sync`, `unpushed`, `behind`, or `unknown`, with a count when known      |
| `checks`               | list   | one row per latest check: `name` and `status` (conclusion folded in)        |
| `comments`             | list   | one row per comment, newest first                                           |
| `truncated`            | bool   | a capped surface had a further page, so a list is a prefix                  |

A `comments` row:

| field                        | type   | meaning                                                              |

| `author`, `author_is_bot`    | string, bool | the `@login` and whether it is a bot                              |
| `anchor`                     | string | `path:line` for a `finding`, the literal kind word otherwise            |
| `body`, `snippet`            | string | the text as GitHub returns it, no chrome-stripping or format parsing; only a `finding` carries a snippet |
| `created_at`                 | time   | post time, the newest-first sort key                                    |
| `is_resolved`, `is_outdated` | bool   | thread state for a `finding`, always false otherwise                    |
| `reply_count`                | int    | replies on a `finding`'s thread beyond the root                         |

## Behavior

### GitHub hosts

`github_host` in reviewr's `config.toml` adds one GitHub Enterprise hostname. Its value contract lives in `config.md`.

```toml
github_host = "github.example.com"
```

Host matching is case-insensitive. A missing setting adds no Enterprise host. `github.com` remains supported when the setting is present.

Both remotes use the primary fetch URL after Git's `url.*.insteadOf` rewrite. A separate push URL does not affect PR reads.

| remote state                                                               | outcome                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `upstream` names `github.com` or exact `github_host` with `owner/repository` | reviewr reads that repository                                            |
| `upstream` is absent, hostless, unsupported, or malformed                  | `origin` determines the repository                                       |
| reading `upstream` fails                                                   | reviewr shows the retryable Git error and never falls through            |
| `origin` names `github.com` or exact `github_host` with `owner/repository`   | reviewr reads that repository                                            |
| `origin` names another hosted repository                                   | reviewr names the unsupported host and points Enterprise users to config |
| `origin` is missing or hostless                                            | reviewr says the PR tab needs a supported GitHub `upstream` or `origin`   |
| `origin` names a supported host without `owner/repository`                  | reviewr says the GitHub origin is malformed                              |
| reading `origin` fails                                                     | reviewr shows the retryable Git error                                    |

A fork clone with `origin` pointed at the fork and a supported `upstream` pointed at the base
repository resolves the base repository's PR without setup.

Canonical SSH remotes work in scp-style (`git@host:owner/repository.git`) and `ssh://` forms. Hosted
URL forms use `http://`, `https://`, or `git://`. File URLs and other schemes are not GitHub
repository identities. SSH aliases are not inferred as canonical GitHub hosts. `GH_HOST` cannot
redirect a fetch.

### Resolution

The worktree's published commits nominate pull requests, and containment admits them. A branch name never proves identity, so names play no part in resolution.

- Each fetch pins `HEAD` and the base ref to commit OIDs. Ancestry, distance, and sync calculations use those pins while the agent commits beside it.
- The publication points are the nearest ancestors of the pinned `HEAD` present on `origin`. A point that is an ancestor of any resolved base entry proves nothing and is skipped.
- With no publication point beyond the pinned base, the tab shows the empty state. The worktree has published no reviewable work.
- With no base resolvable, no point is provable and the tab shows the empty state.
- Each publication point is asked of the forge: which pull requests contain this commit. The query runs against the `origin` repository, where the commits live. An `origin` on another host proves nothing on the target's forge, so the target repository stands in. Only PRs based on the resolved repository target count.
- Every resolved PR therefore contains the worktree's published work. There is no other admission path.
- Exactly one open PR resolves when one contains a publication point.
- Several open PRs disambiguate in order: a head equal to the pinned `HEAD`, a head equal to a publication point, the head named by the recorded upstream. A record naming a configured base is tracking, not publication, and never joins the tiebreak. Failing all three, reviewr surfaces the count, never a silent guess.
- With no open PR, the newest-merged PR containing a publication point shows as historical state.
- A worktree parked on published base history keeps its epilogue: the absorbed tip still nominates, and a merged PR whose head is exactly that commit resolves as history. Containment proves nothing for an absorbed commit.
- A PR closed without merging does not associate. It still resolves as history through exact identity: an `origin` branch tip at a publication point names it, and its reported head equals that point.
- With none at all, the body says only `No pull request yet. Ready to ship?`
- A fork PR resolves through the same query: the commits live on the fork (`origin`), and the association carries the base-repository PR. `pr-tab.md` marks the fork case.
- Local staleness costs recall first: a stale `origin/*` ref can hide a publication point. A stale base ref can also admit mainline history as one, until a fetch heals it.
- A detached `HEAD` has no pin and shows the empty state.

What a user observes:

- A worktree pushed as `git push origin HEAD:<other-name>` resolves its PR. The pushed commits are the publication point, whatever the name.
- A teammate's PR parked at this worktree's exact `HEAD` never beats the PR on the recorded upstream.
- A remote branch extending `HEAD` can be a colleague's continuation of this work. Its PR resolves when no better pick exists. The header names the resolved branch, and `sync` shows `behind`.
- A worktree with no commits beyond the base shows the empty state. A sibling worktree's PR never attaches to it.
- A reused branch name never resurrects an earlier, unrelated PR. Old PRs do not contain this worktree's commits.
- The worktree's own merged PR shows as history while the space stays parked on its branch, even after the base absorbs the merge.
- A rebase discards the old publication points. Between the rebase and its force-push, the tab shows the empty state. The push restores it on the next poll.

### Derived state

- `merge` folds GitHub's fields to the blockers worth surfacing: `CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY` → `conflicting`, `BLOCKED` → `blocked`, and everything else (`CLEAN`, `BEHIND`, `UNSTABLE`, still-computing `UNKNOWN`) → `clean`, which the footer shows as nothing.
- `mergeable=UNKNOWN` is GitHub computing lazily. It folds to `clean` unless `mergeStateStatus` is `DIRTY`.
- `sync` compares the pinned `HEAD` OID to the PR's `head_oid`: equal is `in_sync`, `HEAD` ahead is `unpushed` with a `git rev-list --count` count, and `head_oid` ahead is `behind`. If the PR head object is unavailable locally, the relation is `unknown`; reviewr never guesses `in_sync`.
- `unpushed` means the checks and comments on screen describe an older commit than the local tree.

### Checks

- A check row is the latest run for its name. A passed re-run replaces an earlier failure.
- Check runs and commit statuses normalize into one list.
- A top-level rollup gives the overall pass or fail.

### Comments

- Three surfaces merge into one list: submitted reviews, inline threads, and conversation comments.
- A bot's PR-level posts collapse to its latest. A human's are each kept.
- `is_resolved` and `is_outdated` come from GitHub, never recomputed against the worktree.
- Outdated and resolved threads stay in the list with their marker.
- Each surface reads its newest 100 rows, never paged to exhaustion. A further page on any surface — reviews, comments, threads, or checks — sets `truncated`, and `pr-tab.md` marks the capped list, so it is never presented as complete.

### Refresh

- The first fetch starts when the panel opens, so the tab is populated before the user reaches it.
- A refetch fires on entering the tab, on the `refresh` binding (default `r`), and on the agent's turn-end (a `working` → `idle`/`done` edge) while the tab is active. A turn may have pushed or merged, changing forge state with no other local signal.
- A fallback poll refetches every 60 seconds while the tab is active. Off the tab there is no polling.
- A fetch-input change observed on refresh clears the current PR. It starts a fetch while the tab is active; otherwise the next tab entry starts it.
- One fetch is in flight at a time. One or more triggers arriving mid-flight supersede its result and start one fresh fetch when it completes.
- A GitHub change during a fetch can appear on the following fetch.
- Each fetch uses one validated config snapshot for host and base selection (→ CFG-ONE-SNAPSHOT, `config.md`).
- A GitHub result paints only if the current config, repository target, pinned `HEAD`, pinned base, and
  publication points still match the input that produced it. If reviewr cannot prove that match, the
  result never paints. An active tab starts one replacement; an inactive tab waits for entry.
- If the repository target is proven unchanged before a later branch-state read fails, the visible
  same-target snapshot stays with a retry notice; the next refresh performs a fresh GitHub fetch.
- The snapshot re-derives in full each fetch. reviewr keeps no hidden or historical PR cache beyond the visible snapshot.
- Exiting reviewr stops scheduling and restores the terminal immediately. No later PR completion
  can paint.

## Failure semantics

reviewr reads GitHub and never writes it, so every failure degrades to a clear state. `Changes` and `All files` are unaffected.

- A same-input failure preserves the visible snapshot and shows its remedy. With no same-input snapshot, the remedy fills the tab.

| failure               | remedy shown                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| missing `gh`          | the install step                  |
| unauthenticated fetch | `gh auth login --hostname <host>` |
| any other fetch error | the retry error                   |

- A failure before the repository target resolves replaces any snapshot with the retryable Git error. reviewr cannot prove that the snapshot still belongs to the current target.
- A branch-state Git failure after the same repository target resolves preserves the visible
  same-target snapshot with the retryable Git error.
- An unsupported origin names the host and points Enterprise users to `github_host`.
- No PR at any lifecycle state shows a calm empty state. The next poll lights the tab up when a PR appears.
- Every read is side-effect-free.
- Two active PR tabs on one worktree converge within one poll interval. An inactive tab catches up when entered.

## Non-goals

- No writes to GitHub. reviewr never posts, resolves a thread, re-runs a check, or merges. It never routes PR feedback to the agent.
- No repository selector or cross-repository search.
- No different parent repositories across sibling worktrees from one clone. Use a separate clone for each parent.
- No SSH host-alias normalization. An alias-only repository needs a canonical-host remote.
- No discovery of an unrecorded publication name on a non-`origin` remote.
- No event subscription. The snapshot polls `gh`, no webhook or socket.
- No server-version compatibility layer for Enterprise schemas.
- No second forge. GitHub via `gh` only.
