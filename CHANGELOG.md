# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.19.0] — 2026-07-18

### Changed
- **Tab switches are instant.** Entering `Changes` or `All files` paints the tab exactly as you
  left it in one frame and refreshes right behind it, on any repo size. A first-ever visit loads
  before its frame, so the header never describes a tab that shows nothing.
- **`All files` is fast in huge repos.** The ignored-tree listing no longer walks inside ignored
  directories. Entering the tab dropped from over a second to well under 200ms on a 10k-file repo
  with gigabytes of ignored trees, and every background refresh sheds the same cost.
- **The `PR` tab keeps its snapshot while it refreshes.** New commits no longer blank the tab to
  `loading`. It clears only when the repository changes or the shown pull request's branch stops
  being a candidate. A turn-end refetch now fires from any tab, so opening `PR` after the agent
  finishes finds fresh data already on its way.

## [0.18.1] — 2026-07-16

### Changed
- **Copy and onboarding are clearer.** Export confirmations now distinguish adding comments to the
  agent input from copying them, PR failures pair the problem with a concrete recovery step, and
  config errors explain that a corrected file reloads automatically. The README now shows how to
  open reviewr immediately after installation, gives the last-turn diff its own feature callout,
  and demonstrates the full comment-to-agent handoff.
- **The demo shows reviewr itself.** The README recording now runs the installed plugin full-screen
  with its real terminal palette instead of simulating an adjacent agent pane.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-07-15

### Changed
- **Fork pull requests resolve automatically.** A readable, supported `upstream` remote now selects
  the base repository. An absent or unsupported `upstream` falls back to `origin`; a Git read failure
  stays visible and never falls through. SSH host aliases are no longer inferred: GitHub.com and
  configured Enterprise hosts must match exactly. Literal `github.com-*` Enterprise hostnames remain
  valid when configured exactly. A Git failure before the target resolves replaces any snapshot
  whose repository can no longer be proven. The ordinary empty state now says `No pull request yet.
  Ready to ship?`. (#18; thanks @ubuntudroid for the report and original fix.)
- **Rust 1.97 is now the minimum toolchain.** Local builds, Clippy, CI, and release builds use the
  same pinned compiler version.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Four-way navigator placement.** The navigator can sit on the right, bottom, left, or top of
  every tab. Press `p` to cycle clockwise, or set `navigator_position` in plugin config. Side and
  stacked layouts remember separate sizes, with `<` / `>` and divider dragging available on both
  axes. (#16)
- **Independent PR navigator scrolling.** The checks and comments viewport scrolls without moving
  its selection. `Tab` changes pane focus, and page keys scroll the focused PR pane.

### Changed
- **Navigator resize actions have position-neutral names.** Config uses `navigator-grow` and
  `navigator-shrink`; `list-wider` and `list-narrower` remain accepted aliases.
- **Breaking: `p` is a new default key.** A custom binding that already uses `p` now collides with
  `navigator-position` and must be moved before the config becomes valid again.

## [0.16.1] — 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **The diff cursor is visible from the file list.** The diff pane hid its cursor row whenever the
  file list held focus, so a hunk step driven from the list moved a cursor you could not see. Both
  panes now always mark their cursor row, filling it brightly when the pane has focus and a step
  softer when it does not — the file list already behaved this way.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Changeset traversal.** `]` and `[` jump to the next and previous hunk, so the whole changeset
  reads hunk by hunk without a detour through the file list. At a file's last hunk the key stops:
  the footer offers `] next file`, and pressing it again crosses, so a held key never flies past a
  file. A file with no hunk — a binary, a pure rename — is crossed over. `f` and `F` jump to the
  next and previous file outright, from either pane. All four are rebindable, like the rest of the
  keymap.

### Changed
- **Pane divider keys.** The divider moves with `<` and `>`, each key pointing the way it goes, so
  `<` widens the file list and `>` narrows it. The old `]` and `[` now step hunks.
- **Breaking: `]`, `[`, `f`, `F`, `<`, and `>` are new default keys.** A `[keybindings]` config
  that binds any of them to another action now collides with a default. A collision makes the
  whole config invalid, so the sidebar shows only the config error until you move the key. The
  error names both actions involved.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Aggregate change stats in the header.** The header now shows the active scope's line totals
  next to the changed-file count (`9 changed  +42 −18`), colored like the per-file stats. A zero
  side drops, and an empty changeset shows the bare count.
- **Configurable startup scope.** A new `default_scope` config key (`"uncommitted"`, `"branch"`,
  or `"last-turn"`) names the scope the sidebar starts in. It seeds only a fresh sidebar:
  switching with `u`/`b`/`t` wins for the session, and a config reread never switches the
  active scope.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-07-13

### Changed
- **Markdown preview in the Changes tab.** The `preview` binding (default `m`) now toggles the
  rendered preview from a markdown file's diff, not only in All files. It renders the file's
  current content, so a deleted file's toggle is inert. Returning to the diff leaves the cursor,
  scroll, and folds exactly where they were. The preview choice is kept per tab.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Markdown rendering.** PR comment bodies and the PR description render as styled markdown —
  headings, emphasis, lists, quotes, links with dim destinations, tables, and fenced code
  highlighted with the same syntax theme as the diff panes. A wide table degrades to its source
  text. Control characters and bidi overrides in bodies render as visible placeholders, never raw.
- **PR description card.** A non-empty PR description pins a `description` row at the top of
  the PR tab's navigator, above the checks. Its body reads in the left pane.
- **Markdown preview in All files.** The `preview` binding (default `m`) toggles a read-only
  rendered preview on `.md`/`.markdown` files, named `· preview` in the pane title. Source stays
  the commentable view. The toggle carries your reading position both ways, and an unscrolled
  round-trip restores the exact cursor and scroll.
- **Clickable links.** A link in rendered markdown — the preview, the PR description, or a
  comment body — opens in the browser on click. An anchor link (`#section`) scrolls to its
  heading instead. Only `http`/`https` destinations open, anything else is inert, and a
  destination carrying control or bidi characters never reaches the OS.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Customizable keybindings.** A `[keybindings]` table in reviewr's `config.toml` rebinds every
  single-key shortcut per action, with several keys per action so CJK input sources can alias the
  composed character their layout produces on the same physical key (e.g. `comment = ["c", "ㅊ"]`).
  A key bound to two actions invalidates the whole file with an error naming both actions. Footer
  and header hints follow the active bindings. (#12)

### Changed
- **The comments list no longer closes on `q`.** It closes on `esc` and the `comments` binding
  (default `l`). `q` inside the list is inert.
- **Bindings act uniformly wherever their action fires.** The comments list now answers `S` and
  `Y` for send and copy, matching the main panes.
- **Ctrl chords no longer trigger character shortcuts.** A bound key fires only unmodified.
  `ctrl+u` / `ctrl+d` half-page movement and the comment editor's chords are unchanged.
- **Degraded PR messages name the active refresh key.** "press r" hints follow a rebound
  `refresh` binding.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-07-10

### Added
- **GitHub Enterprise support in the PR tab.** Set one bare `github_host` in reviewr's
  `config.toml`; GitHub.com remains available, exact Enterprise origins and documented SSH aliases
  resolve to their canonical API host, and every `gh api` call pins that host explicitly. Origin
  rewrites, malformed URLs, unsupported hosts, and authentication remedies are surfaced directly.
  (#11)

### Changed
- **Plugin configuration now fails loud as one value.** Unknown keys or invalid values block the
  sidebar, actions, and events instead of silently falling back or partially applying settings.
  The running sidebar shows only the path-aware config error, discards work from the invalidated
  snapshot, and recovers after the file is corrected. Missing files and omitted keys still use
  defaults.
- **PR refreshes reject stale work by complete input.** Host, repository, branch, pinned `HEAD`,
  candidate branches, and base settings are probed off-thread. Superseded results never replace
  the current view; same-input failures preserve it with the exact remedy.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- **`open` and `close` actions for scripts and layout plugins.** `herdr plugin action invoke
  open --plugin persiyanov.reviewr` opens the sidebar and does nothing when one is already
  open. `close` removes it, including a sidebar herdr's plugin registry forgot after a restart.
  `toggle` keeps its key. `open` ignores `auto_open`, so a layout that opts out of auto-open
  can still place reviewr deliberately. See `specs/herdr-host.md` and the README's layout
  recipe. (#9)

### Changed
- **The sidebar is found by its pane label, not a state file.** Toggle, open, and close now
  look for the `reviewr` pane in the live pane list. A duplicate pane from a race is swept by
  the next close, nothing goes stale across crashes or herdr restarts, and no state files are
  written.
- **Actions report their outcome.** A refused action (no workspace context, or opening outside
  a git repo) exits non-zero with one line saying why. A success prints the pane it acted on.
  Both land in `herdr plugin log list`.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **The PR tab now finds your PR even when the local branch name differs from the pushed
  name.** Agent worktrees often push with `git push origin HEAD:<name>` and no `-u`, which left
  the tab stuck on "no PR for this branch yet" while the PR sat open on GitHub. reviewr now
  derives every branch name the worktree's work could be published under — the recorded
  upstream, remote branches that carry the worktree's commits, and the local name — and asks
  GitHub about all of them in one call. GitHub decides which name holds the PR, so a stale
  upstream or a checkpoint push can never hide it. See `specs/forge-host.md`. (#10)
- **A git hiccup no longer reads as "no PR".** A failing git command during the fetch (a lock
  held by `git gc`, a ref pruned mid-read) now freezes the last good view with the retry marker
  instead of blanking the tab or showing a wrong empty state. Git errors are also read with a
  pinned locale, so a non-English git classifies the same way.

### Added
- **The header names the branch that resolved.** The resolved head branch shows dim next to the
  status chip, marked `⑂` when the head lives in a fork, and drops first on a narrow pane. The
  local branch can differ from the PR's branch now, so the header tells you which one you are
  looking at.
- **Empty states that explain themselves.** With no PR the tab names the branch names it
  queried. Several matching open PRs show the count. A detached HEAD gets its own wording.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **A hard kill mid-snapshot no longer wedges the sidebar's refresh for that worktree.** A crash
  during the turn snapshot's `git add` could leave a stale `reviewr-turn-index.lock` in the
  worktree's git dir, and every refresh after that failed with `refresh failed: git ["add", "-A"]
  failed: fatal: Unable to create … File exists` until the lock was deleted by hand. The snapshot
  now clears any leftover temp index and its lock — both private to reviewr — before running and
  on every exit path. See `specs/herdr-host.md`.
- **`herdr plugin install` now delivers the current release again.** v0.8.1 shipped with
  `herdr-plugin.toml` still saying `0.8.0`, and `install.sh` reads the manifest to pick the
  download tag, so installs were silently getting the v0.8.0 binary — without the Send resolver
  fix from #6. Both version files now carry 0.8.2.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **`Send` no longer fails with "no unambiguous agent" when a plugin sidebar or a plain shell
  shares the tab or workspace (#6).** `herdr agent list` returns every pane, but only entries
  carrying an `agent` field are real agents — the resolver now counts those alone, so one agent
  plus any number of non-agent panes resolves cleanly. Turn tracking uses the same resolver, so
  `last-turn` no longer pauses in these layouts. A refused send now also says why — no agent
  here, or several — and points at `y` to copy to the clipboard instead. Thanks @worldnine for
  the diagnosis and reproduction. See `specs/herdr-host.md`.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **`auto_open` config key** — `auto_open = false` in reviewr's `config.toml` turns off the
  `worktree.created` auto-open, so a layout plugin like herdr-plus can furnish a fresh worktree
  undisturbed and reviewr opens only on the toggle key, in any placement. Defaults to `true`
  (today's behavior); an unknown value falls back to the default. See `specs/herdr-host.md`. (#5)

### Changed
- README now spells out where reviewr's config file lives on disk
  (`~/.config/herdr/plugins/config/persiyanov.reviewr/config.toml`) instead of only naming
  `$HERDR_PLUGIN_CONFIG_DIR`, which users cannot resolve from their shell. (#5)

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **The sidebar no longer opens a blank pane when the first `git` scan is slow, failing, or hung
  (#4).** reviewr now initializes the terminal and paints before running any `git`, so a startup
  scan error shows `load failed: …` in the status line and a hung `git` shows a frozen-but-visible
  sidebar — never the blank pane herdr leaves for a process that blocks or exits before it renders.
  See `specs/herdr-host.md`.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Configurable base branch** — `base_branches` in reviewr's `config.toml` sets the ordered
  candidate list for the `branch` scope, re-read on refresh. reviewr uses the first entry that
  exists in the repo (default `origin/main` → `origin/master` → `main` → `master`), so one setting
  works across repos with different trunks and the base is reachable inside herdr, where no CLI
  flag is. `--base` still overrides. See `specs/review-model.md`. (#3)

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **Configurable toggle placement** — `toggle_placement` (`split` | `overlay` | `zoomed` | `tab`,
  default `split`) and `toggle_direction` (`right` | `down`, split only, default `right`) in
  reviewr's `config.toml` set how the toggle opens the sidebar. The `worktree.created` auto-open
  stays a `split`/`tab` (the covering placements open only on a manual toggle). An unknown value
  falls back to its default. See `specs/herdr-host.md`. (#2)

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Selectable themes** — 18 named palettes (Catppuccin Mocha/Latte/Frappé/Macchiato, Dracula,
  Nord, Gruvbox dark/light, One dark/light, Solarized dark/light, GitHub light, Monokai,
  Tokyo Night day/night, Rosé Pine / Dawn), set via `theme = "<name>"` in reviewr's
  `config.toml` (re-read on refresh) or `--theme` for a dev run; default `catppuccin`. One theme
  colors the whole UI — chrome and syntax together — replacing the hardcoded Catppuccin Mocha.
  An unknown name falls back to the default. See `specs/theme.md`.

### Changed
- **`--theme` now selects the whole theme** (chrome + syntax), not just the syntect syntax theme.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-28

### Changed
- **Context-aware footer** — the footer is now a live action bar: it shows the actions available
  for what the cursor is on (comment a line, edit/delete the comment under the cursor, expand a
  fold or directory, send), the most likely one highlighted, dropping the least relevant to fit
  one line. `u/b/t scope` stays available everywhere while reviewing, and `s send N` appears once
  a comment is written. Replaces the static key-hint line.

- **Simpler PR merge status** — the footer's merge state now shows only the actionable blockers,
  `conflicts` and `blocked`; GitHub's `behind`, `unstable`, and still-computing states (jargon a
  reviewer can't act on) fold into nothing.
- **PR tab panes named distinctly** — the right navigator is now `Checks & comments` instead of a
  second `PR`, so it no longer repeats the left reader's title.

### Fixed
- **PR empty state renders once** — "no PR for this branch yet…" (and the other PR loading and
  degraded messages) showed in the header, the navigator, and the read pane at the same time; it
  now shows only in the read pane.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **`PR` tab** — a read-only mirror of the branch's open pull request, read from GitHub via
  `gh`: its identity and state (draft/open/merged/closed, mergeability, unpushed-commit sync),
  its checks with a pass/fail rollup, and its comments (reviews, inline findings, and plain
  comments merged newest-first, with `resolved`/`outdated` markers). Select a comment to read it;
  `o` or a click on the header chip opens the PR in the browser. It fetches when the panel opens
  and refetches on entering the tab, on `r`, on the agent's turn-end, and on a 60s fallback poll;
  a capped list shows a `+more on GitHub` marker. It never writes to GitHub.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-27

### Removed
- **`config.toml` and its `keep` list** — reviewr no longer opts git-ignored paths into the
  **Changes** tab. A kept ignored path had no baseline in the commit scopes, so it listed as an
  addition forever — every milestone plan piled up and never cleared. Now **every scope respects
  `.gitignore` without exception**: to review a file, track it. A `keep` entry in an existing
  `config.toml` is now ignored (the file is no longer read).

### Changed
- **Plans are tracked, not ignored** — `docs/plans/` is removed from `.gitignore`, so a plan
  shows in **Changes** while uncommitted and ages out once committed, like any tracked file.
  **All files** still browses every ignored path (dimmed).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **`config.toml`** — a reviewr config file in herdr's per-plugin config dir, re-read on
  refresh. Its `keep` list (gitignore globs) opts git-ignored paths into the **Changes** tab as
  untracked, so an ignored-but-intentional file (a plan, a sample env) is reviewable while build
  output stays out.
- **All files** now lists git-ignored paths too, dimmed; a wholly-ignored directory
  (`target/`, `node_modules/`) is one collapsed row that loads its contents only on expand.

### Changed
- **`branch` scope** now diffs the worktree against the merge-base with the base branch — a
  superset of `uncommitted` that adds the branch's committed work — instead of the committed-only
  `merge-base...HEAD`. It no longer shows empty when the branch's changes are uncommitted.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Corrected the keybinding example in the herdr API notes: the `plugin_action`
  command is `persiyanov.reviewr.toggle` (the manifest `id`), not `reviewr.toggle`
  (the `name`). The wrong id resolves to a non-existent plugin and herdr reports
  "plugin action not found".

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-26

First public release as the herdr plugin `persiyanov.reviewr`.

### Added
- **Changes tab** — changed files for the active scope (`uncommitted` / `branch` /
  `last-turn`) with `+/-` stats and syntax-highlighted unified diffs.
- **All files tab** — browse the whole worktree tree and read any file's current
  content in the diff pane.
- **Comment surface** — select a line range, write a comment, and **Add all to chat**
  to send the set to the agent as `path:start-end — comment`; clipboard export via
  `pbcopy` / `wl-copy` / `xclip` / `xsel`.
- **last-turn scope** — snapshots the worktree on each observed agent turn start
  (private `refs/reviewr/` baseline ref) to show only the agent's latest changes.
- Packaged as a herdr plugin: `sidebar` pane, `toggle` action, `worktree.created`
  auto-open. Prebuilt binaries downloaded on `herdr plugin install` via
  `herdr/install.sh` from GitHub Releases (no Rust toolchain required).
- Project scaffold: edition 2024, pinned toolchain, centralized `[lints]`,
  CI (fmt + clippy `-D warnings` + test + build), release workflow, `just` tasks,
  `cargo-deny` config, MIT license.
